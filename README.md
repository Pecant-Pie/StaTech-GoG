# StaTech-Industry: Garden of Glass
A fork of StaTech-Industry that adds a Botania Skyblock mode that leads into the original Modern Industrialization progression path. Join the discord for the original pack [here](https://discord.gg/RDaJEnN3uS). Click [here](https://github.com/Pecant-Pie/StaTech-GoG/blob/main/MODLIST.md) for a full list of mods.

This modpack also includes the following resources. Do not report any issues you might experience with these to their developers, but rather to this mod's Discord.

## Installation
I recommend the use of [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) for handling modded installs. The following instructions assume you have MultiMC installed with your Minecraft account signed in already. To install the latest version of StaTech Industry: Garden of Glass, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/Pecant-Pie/StaTech-GoG/releases) and download the .zip of the latest version.
2. In MultiMC, click "Add Instance" then select the "Import from zip" tab on the left. Navigate to where you downloaded the .zip and click Ok.
3. Click "Ok" and allow for the process to finish. 
4. Click "Edit Instance" under the StaTech Industry: GoG instance, and then click "Settings" on the left, and ensure you have at least 4-6 GB or RAM dedicated to the pack, as well as your version of Java is Java 17 or higher.
